        <p class= "about-me">I am Logan Ayers if the header hasn't made you aware. I was born in Georgia, but have lived in many different locations. From Connecticut, to Ohio, to Texas, to England, I have done my fair share of traversing the North Western hemisphere. I have lived in Kansas for 5 years now. </p>

        <p class= "about-me">    I started coding in highschool, starting with relatively easy things, like coding a card deck that shuffles itself or recreating Space Invader in Python. I attended the coding bootcamp at KU where I learned things like web design (Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Java).</p>
